## Known Bugs

There are likely still some UI things that need to be tweaked, but excluding some edge cases the game works wonderfuly.

There may be "ghost" messages left behind that will need to be set back to null or otherwise hidden, but should be a minor issue.


Most of the odd stuff in the combatRound.js can be tweaked easily by adding a die roll as level increases, etc, etc.  This could go on continually until playability is the best it can be.
